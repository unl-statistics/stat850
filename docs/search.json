There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more.\nPick R or Python, and solve the murder mystery, showing all of your work in this document.\nYour solution must be reproducible – that is, you should use dplyr verbs, table joins, etc. to solve the mystery, rather than just looking through the tables yourselves.\nYou may work in groups of 2-4 people on this assignment. Each person should turn in their own assignment, but should list their group members as authors.\nMake sure you do your due diligence! You should double check your answer and print out the guilty party’s interview from the database.\nWhen you are finished with the assignment:\n\nOnce you have finished this assignment, render the document (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-K or the Render button).\nCommit the qmd file and any other files you have changed to the repository and push your changes.\nIn Canvas, submit a link to your github repository containing the updated files.\nProvide the name of the guilty party in the text input field on Canvas, and make sure all of your work is on GitHub to receive full credit.\n\nThe chunks below use the code to read in each of the 8 tables of data for this assignment.\nHints:\n\nYou can use a lot of filter statements, but it will in many cases be easier to use joins.\nSee if you can write code that doesn’t require you to type out knowledge gained from a previous clue (e.g. pipe your results from one query into the next)\n\n\nA crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on January 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use R and SAS to navigate through this network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.\nThis database schema may help you figure out how to navigate the database:\n\n\n\nsql-murder-mystery database schema diagram"

To get started, this blog post provides a nice checklist to get you thinking:\n\n\nWhat question(s) are you trying to solve (or prove wrong)?\nWhat kind of data do you have and how do you treat different types?\nWhat’s missing from the data and how do you deal with it?\nWhere are the outliers and why should you care about them?\nHow can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?\n\n\n\nGenerating Questions\nGenerate at least 5 questions you might explore using this database of cookie ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkimming the Data\nOne thing we often want to do during EDA is to examine the quality of the data - are there missing values? What quirks might exist in the dataset?\nThe skimr package in R, and the similar skimpy package in python (which has a much better name, in my opinion), can help provide visual summaries of the data.\nInstall both packages, and read the package documentation (R, Python).\n[Part 1] Use each package and generate summaries of your data that require the use of at least some non-default options in each package’s skim function.\n[Part 2] Write 1-2 sentences about what you can tell from each summary display you generate. Did you discover anything new about the data?\n\n\nGenerating Tables\nAnother useful technique for exploratory data analysis is to generate summary tables. You may want to use the dplyr package in R (group_by or count functions), as well as the groupby and count methods in Pandas. Python example, R example\n[Part 1] Using R and Python, generate a table that shows what proportion of recipes contain each type of ingredient, for the most common 20 ingredients.\n[Part 2] Print out a character string that lists all of the ingredients that do not appear in at least 20 recipes.\n(Delete this note, but you can include data values inline in markdown text by using backticks, at least in R. For instance, here is R’s built in value for pi: 3.1415927. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work in python using the knitr markdown engine, but you can print the list out in python anyways using a code chunk.)\n\n\nVisualization\nUsing whatever plotting system you are comfortable with in R or python, see if you can create a couple of useful exploratory data visualizations which address one of the questions you wrote above - or another question which you’ve come up with as you’ve worked on this assignment.\n[Part 1] Create at least one plot (it doesn’t have to be pretty) that showcases an interesting facet of the data.\n[Part 2] Write 2-3 sentences about what you can learn from that plot and what directions you might want to investigate from here."

Can you generalize this, writing a function fizzbuzz that takes a variable x and returns a corresponding fizzbuzzified variable? Your function should be able to handle x that is a vector or a scalar value, and should store your solution in yy.\n\nxx &lt;- sample(1:100, 10) # get a random xx\nyy &lt;- rep(NA, 10)\n\nfizzbuzz &lt;- function(x) {\n  # Your code goes here\n}\n\nyy &lt;- fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres &lt;- cbind(x = xx, result = yy)\nres\n\n        x\n [1,]  65\n [2,]   7\n [3,]  71\n [4,]  36\n [5,]  66\n [6,]  20\n [7,]   3\n [8,]  86\n [9,]  21\n[10,] 100\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom random import choices\nxx = np.array(choices(range(100), k = 10)) + 1\n\n\ndef fizzbuzz(x):\n  y = [np.nan]*len(x) # this just defines something to return\n  # Your code goes here\n  return y\n\nyy = fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": xx, \"result\": yy})\nres\n\n    x  result\n0  32     NaN\n1  98     NaN\n2  31     NaN\n3  42     NaN\n4  40     NaN\n5  36     NaN\n6  36     NaN\n7  13     NaN\n8  53     NaN\n9  33     NaN\n\n\n\n\nDefensive Programming\nYou cannot always assume that the person using your functions knows what they’re doing. Add a check to the function you wrote in the last question so that it will handle non-numeric input by issuing an error message.\nIn R, you can use the function stopifnot() to halt function execution if there is an error; this will give you a basic error message.\n\nstopifnot(2 &gt; 3)\n\nError: 2 &gt; 3 is not TRUE\n\n\nIn Python, you can use a try: statement with a except: clause. This functions like an if-else statement, where if no error occurs, the except statement is never executed.\n\ntry: \n  int(\"hello\")\nexcept ValueError: \n  print(\"Error: could not turn value into an integer\")\n\nError: could not turn value into an integer\n\n\nSee more examples of this in the Input Validation section of the textbook.\n\nxx &lt;- sample(1:100, 10) # get a random xx\nyy &lt;- rep(NA, 10)\n\nfizzbuzz &lt;- function(x) {\n  # Your code goes here\n}\n\nyy &lt;- fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres &lt;- cbind(x = xx, result = yy)\nres\n\n       x\n [1,] 88\n [2,] 10\n [3,] 38\n [4,] 36\n [5,] 48\n [6,] 66\n [7,] 21\n [8,] 78\n [9,] 40\n[10,] 24\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom random import choices\nxx = np.array(choices(range(100), k = 10)) + 1\n\n\ndef fizzbuzz(x):\n  y = [np.nan]*len(x) # this just defines something to return\n  # Your code goes here\n  return y\n\nyy = fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": xx, \"result\": yy})\nres\n\n    x  result\n0  99     NaN\n1  84     NaN\n2  75     NaN\n3  28     NaN\n4  57     NaN\n5  60     NaN\n6  43     NaN\n7  22     NaN\n8  19     NaN\n9  80     NaN"

It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!\nGitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.\nGitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world.

    "text": "Understanding the GitHub flow\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.\n\nRepositories\nA repository is where your project work happens–think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.\n\n\nCloning\nWhen a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read “Cloning a Repository”.\n\n\nCommitting and pushing\nCommitting and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.” You can also add a helpful commit message to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. “Added a README with information about our project”).\nOnce you have a commit or multiple commits that you’re ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you’ll get used to it 🙂"

    "section": "💻 GitHub terms to know",
    "text": "💻 GitHub terms to know\n\nRepositories\nWe mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let’s talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your “GitHub dashboard” helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you’re logged in to see it!\nRepositories also contain READMEs. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. 😄 To learn more about repositories read “Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories and “About README’s”.\n\n\nBranches\nYou can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository—main. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository. To learn more about branching, read “About Branches”.\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use branches.\n\n\nForks\nA fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else’s project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects! To learn more about forking, read “Fork a repo”\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use forks.\n\n\nPull requests\nWhen working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch. To learn more about pull requests, read “About Pull Requests”.\nNote: In this course, you will not be required to use pull requests.\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!\nFor larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them in this “About Project boards document. You likely won’t need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they’re a great way to organize your team’s work! You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read “About Issues”.\n\n\nYour user profile\nYour profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you’re interested in, the contributions you’ve made, and the conversations you’ve had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read “Managing Your Profile README”.\n\n\nUsing markdown on GitHub\nYou might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. “Markdown” is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point! To learn more about using GitHub’s flavor of markdown, read “Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax”.\n\n\nEngaging with the GitHub community\nThe GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day—students like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start.\n\nStarring repositories\nIf you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it’s also used as a signal to surface better recommendations on github.com/explore. If you’d like to get back to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. To learn more about starring repositories, read “Saving Repositories with Stars”.\n\n\nFollowing users\nYou can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their public GitHub activity will show up on your dashboard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. To learn more about following users, read “Following People”.\n\n\nBrowsing GitHub Explore\nGitHub Explore is a great place to do just that … explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.\nYou can check out the GitHub Explore website at github.com/explore. The more you intereact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be."

Some tips:\n\nPull before you start working, and after each commit.\nWorking in teams on github means that you have to allow for merge conflicts and become skilled at resolving them. This is part of my goal for making you work in groups - forcing you to develop these skills. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97m0N4zIvOs for a demonstration of how to work with merge conflicts in rstudio.\nI do not expect you to work on branches for this project, unless you really want to - with 3 people and a defined scope, you should be able to work out of the main branch with few problems.\nCommit your changes in small, task-oriented batches. Try to work on small tasks and commit as soon as you finish the task. This will reduce merge conflicts.\nMinimize merge conflicts:\nPut each sentence on a different line in your document - this makes it much easier for git to resolve the changes, as git works line-by-line. I make all of my graduate students do this with their papers, and it makes things much easier to work around.\nREAD THE ERROR MESSAGE FROM GIT.\nSeriously, this will help you figure out about 90% of the things that go wrong. Git actually has good error messages that help you know what to do next.\nOnly commit the essential files necessary to compile your project report to github. This will reduce merge conflicts and save you a ton of time in the long run.\n\nStick to original files only - i.e. don’t commit pictures generated by R/python, .tex files generated as an intermediate stage, or even html/pdf files that are the final product until the very end. I have set this repository up in such a way that each of the quarto files renders to the _output folder, and git ignores everything in this folder, in the hopes that this will be enough to help you out.\nDo commit any R/python source files you need to e.g. define a shiny application or do some data processing. Organize these in a code folder, and create a header in each code file that describes what the file does and how it relates to other code files in the project.\nDon’t commit any files you didn’t personally create. Be selective in what you add to git. Use the .gitignore file to keep git from tracking files that shouldn’t be added to the repository.\n\n\nI will track your contributions to the project using the python git-fame package, which you can install with the command pip install git-fame.\nI will typically use some variant of the following command to track your group contributions:\ngit fame . --incl=\".(q|R)md\"\nThis only counts modifications to the markdown files, which ensures that whoever adds a dataset to the repository doesn’t get credit for doing a ton of work by just uploading a file. This also ensures that people committing intermediate files don’t get credit for making the repository a mess."

Explain any unique approaches you will take or any interesting features of your dataset that you have to overcome. Cite the source of your dataset, and briefly discuss how it was collected.\nDiscuss the variables in the dataset and if there are anomalies in the variables, provide some visual assessment of the anomalies and explain how they may have arisen. You should cover most of the information in your proposal data section, but should primarily use paragraphs and not lists/tables (the exception may be a list of e.g. items which were measured)."

Here’s a demonstration of how to do that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This figure shows the relationship between sepal width and petal width in irises. I’ve used geom_jitter to combat overplotting, as the data are measured in relatively consistent increments. The figure is drawn with ggplot2 [@ggplot2-package].\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you can reference Figure 1 in the text and the appropriate cross-reference will be generated.\nYou can find additional information about formatting figures generated from code in the quarto documentation."

I have actually set _output to not show up in git, to encourage you all to NOT push the rendered files to github and to instead work from the markdown files directly.\nYou may find it cleaner to create a figure subdirectory and store any figures that aren’t created by R/Python in that folder. I encourage you to organize this repository in a sensible way."
