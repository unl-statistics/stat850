    "text": "In this problem, you will work towards building code that will decompose a number into its prime factors.\nWe’ll start by installing a package that helps work with prime numbers… primes in R, SymPy in Python.\n\n\n\n\nWrite code to install the primes package in R. Run the code.\n\ninstall.packages(\"primes\")\n\n\n\n\nWrite code to install the SymPy package in Python. If you choose to install the package via the terminal, place your code in the bash chunk; otherwise, place your code in the python chunk.\n\npip install sympy\n\n\n%pip install sympy\n\n\n\n\nYou must complete this question regardless of the language used above.\n\nAdd #| eval: false to the first line of the code chunk (below the r or python chunk header) to stop that code from running every time the document is executed.\nList at least one additional way to keep the code in the quarto document but prevent it from running.\n\n\nComment the line of code out using # at the front of the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad the packages you just installed in R and Python using the chunks below.\n\n\n\nlibrary(primes)\n\n\n\n\nHint: SymPy should be typed as sympy when loading the package. You will only need the primerange function in SymPy.\n\nfrom sympy import primerange\n# import sympy as sp\n# import sympy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the generate_primes(min, max) function to generate all the primes between 1 and 47, inclusive. Store these numbers in a variable called myprimes.\n\nmyprimes &lt;- generate_primes(1, 47)\n\n\n\n\nUse the primerange(a, b) function in SymPy to get all primes between 1 and 47, inclusive. Store these numbers in a variable called myprimes.\nYou may have to convert the output of primerange to a list by wrapping the function call in list(). It may be convenient to then convert your list into a numpy array using np.array(list(...)). If you choose to do this, you will also need to import the numpy library.\n\n# import numpy as np\n# myprimes = np.array(list(primerange(1, 48)))\nmyprimes = list(primerange(1, 48)) # without numpy\n\n\n\n\nDo the function parameters you used in R and python differ? Why?\n\nIn Python, intervals are half-open, that is, primerange(1, 47) would not include 47, so it is necessary to use primerange(1, 48) to get 47, which is prime. In R, intervals are closed, so generate_primes(1, 47) includes 47 within the acceptable interval. \n\n\n\n\nUsing your primes variables (in both R and python), determine which primes are a factor of a second variable, x. You may want to test your code on values like x=18, x=25, x = 34, x=43, Your code should output only the prime factors of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder: Modular Division\n\n\n\nRemember that modular division gives you the remainder when dividing a number by another number. x %% 3 (R) or x % 3 (Python) will give you the remainder when x is divided by 3.\nIf x is an integer and the divisor is an integer, the result of modular division will also be an integer.\n\n\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 43\nmyprimes[x%%myprimes == 0]\n\n[1] 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx = 18\n[i for i in myprimes if x%i==0] # without numpy\n\n[2, 3]\n\n# myprimes[x%myprimes == 0] # with numpy\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous section, you determined which primes were factors of a given number. Of course, it is possible to have a number which has multiple occurrences of the same prime factor.\nIn R and python, write a function, prime_n(x, prime), which will determine how many times a single, pre-specified prime number prime can be evenly divided into a number x. You may want to calculate an upper bound for this possibility to help you in your search. Your function should take parameters x and prime and return the integer number of times prime occurs in the prime factorization of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder: Logs with different bases\n\n\n\nThe operation \\(\\log_a(x) = b\\) is defined the number \\(b\\) such that \\(a^b = x\\) for fixed \\(a\\) and \\(x\\). You can use this information to determine the maximum number of times a factor could be repeated when calculating the prime factorization of a number.\nYou will need to load the math library in Python to access the math.log(a, Base) function. In R, the log(x, base) function is built in.\nIt may also be useful to know that the floor() function (R) and math.floor() function (Python) will round down to the integer below a value.\n\n\n\n\n\nprime_n &lt;- function(x, prime) {\n  max_n &lt;- floor(log(x, base =  prime))\n  prime_seq &lt;- prime^(1:max_n)\n  which.max(prime_seq[x%%prime_seq == 0])\n}\n\nprime_n(18, 3)\n\n[1] 2\n\nprime_n(32, 2)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nA number of you handled this using a while loop – which is a great way to do it, and doesn’t require the log hint I gave you.\n\nprime_n &lt;- function(x, prime) {\n  times &lt;- 0\n  while(x%%prime == 0) {\n    x &lt;- x/prime # Divide x by prime\n    times &lt;- times + 1 # Increase times to account for that\n  }\n  \n  if(times == 0) {\n    return(NULL)\n  } else {\n    return(times)\n  }\n}\n\nprime_n(18, 3)\n\n[1] 2\n\nprime_n(32, 2)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\ndef prime_n(x, prime):\n  max_n = math.floor(math.log(x, prime))\n  exp_opts = np.array(range(1, max_n+1))\n  prime_seq = prime**(exp_opts)\n  ans = max(exp_opts[x%prime_seq == 0])\n  return ans\n\n\nprime_n(18, 3)\n\nnp.int64(2)\n\nprime_n(32, 2)\n\nnp.int64(5)\n\n\n\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\ndef prime_n(x, prime):\n  times=0\n  while(x%prime==0):\n    x=x/prime\n    times = times + 1\n  \n  if(times != 0):\n    return times\n  \n  return 'Not a factor'\n\n\nprime_n(18, 3)\n\n2\n\nprime_n(32, 2)\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting the pieces together, use your function and your list of prime factors to determine the prime factorization of a given number. Store your factorization as a data frame with two columns: factor and power, where factor contains the factor and power contains the number of times that factor appears in the prime factorization.\nFor instance, your result for x=18 should be a data frame that looks like this:\n\n\n\nfactor\npower\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n3\n2\n\n\n\nHint:\n\nR: rbind(df, row) will add row to the bottom of df if df is a data frame\nPython: pandas.concat([df, row]) will add row to the bottom of df if df is a data frame.\n\n\n\nUsing the provided scratch paper (please put your name at the top), sketch a basic program flow map that shows how the code you’ve already written fits together to solve this problem.

To get started, this blog post provides a nice checklist to get you thinking:\n\n\nWhat question(s) are you trying to solve (or prove wrong)?\nWhat kind of data do you have and how do you treat different types?\nWhat’s missing from the data and how do you deal with it?\nWhere are the outliers and why should you care about them?\nHow can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?\n\n\n\nGenerating Questions\nGenerate at least 5 questions you might explore using this database of cookie ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkimming the Data\nOne thing we often want to do during EDA is to examine the quality of the data - are there missing values? What quirks might exist in the dataset?\nThe skimr package in R, and the similar skimpy package in python (which has a much better name, in my opinion), can help provide visual summaries of the data.\nInstall both packages, and read the package documentation (R, Python).\n[Part 1] Use each package and generate summaries of your data that require the use of at least some non-default options in each package’s skim function.\n[Part 2] Write 1-2 sentences about what you can tell from each summary display you generate. Did you discover anything new about the data?\n\n\nGenerating Tables\nAnother useful technique for exploratory data analysis is to generate summary tables. You may want to use the dplyr package in R (group_by or count functions), as well as the groupby and count methods in Pandas. Python example, R example\n[Part 1] Using R and Python, generate a table that shows what proportion of recipes contain each type of ingredient, for the most common 20 ingredients.\n[Part 2] Print out a character string that lists all of the ingredients that do not appear in at least 20 recipes.\n(Delete this note, but you can include data values inline in markdown text by using backticks, at least in R. For instance, here is R’s built in value for pi: 3.1415927. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work in python using the knitr markdown engine, but you can print the list out in python anyways using a code chunk.)\n\n\nVisualization\nUsing whatever plotting system you are comfortable with in R or python, see if you can create a couple of useful exploratory data visualizations which address one of the questions you wrote above - or another question which you’ve come up with as you’ve worked on this assignment.\n[Part 1] Create at least one plot (it doesn’t have to be pretty) that showcases an interesting facet of the data.\n[Part 2] Write 2-3 sentences about what you can learn from that plot and what directions you might want to investigate from here."

Can you generalize this, writing a function fizzbuzz that takes a variable x and returns a corresponding fizzbuzzified variable?

Add a check to the function you wrote in the last question so that it will handle non-numeric input by issuing an error message.\nIn R, you can use the function stopifnot() to halt function execution if there is an error; this will give you a basic error message.\n\nstopifnot(2 &gt; 3)\n\nError: 2 &gt; 3 is not TRUE\n\n\nIn Python, you can use a try: statement with a except: clause. This functions like an if-else statement, where if no error occurs, the except statement is never executed.\n\ntry: \n  int(\"hello\")\nexcept ValueError: \n  print(\"Error: could not turn value into an integer\")\n\nError: could not turn value into an integer\n\n\nSee more examples of this in the Input Validation section of the textbook.\n\nxx &lt;- sample(1:100, 10) # get a random xx\nyy &lt;- rep(NA, 10)\n\nfizzbuzz &lt;- function(x) {\n  # Your code goes here\n}\n\nyy &lt;- fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres &lt;- cbind(x = xx, result = yy)\nres\n\n       x\n [1,] 11\n [2,] 24\n [3,] 72\n [4,] 96\n [5,] 67\n [6,] 94\n [7,] 18\n [8,] 55\n [9,] 66\n[10,] 16\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom random import choices\nxx = np.array(choices(range(100), k = 10)) + 1\n\n\ndef fizzbuzz(x):\n  y = [np.nan]*len(x) # this just defines something to return\n  # Your code goes here\n  return y\n\nyy = fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": xx, \"result\": yy})\nres\n\n    x  result\n0  69     NaN\n1  50     NaN\n2  10     NaN\n3  22     NaN\n4  68     NaN\n5  19     NaN\n6   4     NaN\n7  35     NaN\n8  79     NaN\n9  75     NaN"

With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!\nGitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.\nGitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you’re visualizing data or building a new game, there’s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we’ll dig into the rest later."

    "text": "Understanding the GitHub flow\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.\n\nRepositories\nA repository is where your project work happens–think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.\n\n\nCloning\nWhen a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read “Cloning a Repository”.\n\n\nCommitting and pushing\nCommitting and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.” You can also add a helpful commit message to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. “Added a README with information about our project”).\nOnce you have a commit or multiple commits that you’re ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you’ll get used to it 🙂"

    "text": "💻 GitHub terms to know\n\nRepositories\nWe mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let’s talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your “GitHub dashboard” helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you’re logged in to see it!\nRepositories also contain READMEs. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. 😄 To learn more about repositories read “Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories and “About README’s”.\n\n\nBranches\nYou can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository—main. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository. To learn more about branching, read “About Branches”.\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use branches.\n\n\nForks\nA fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else’s project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects! To learn more about forking, read “Fork a repo”\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use forks.\n\n\nPull requests\nWhen working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch. To learn more about pull requests, read “About Pull Requests”.\nNote: In this course, you will not be required to use pull requests.\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!\nFor larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them in this “About Project boards document. You likely won’t need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they’re a great way to organize your team’s work! You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read “About Issues”.\n\n\nYour user profile\nYour profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you’re interested in, the contributions you’ve made, and the conversations you’ve had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read “Managing Your Profile README”.\n\n\nUsing markdown on GitHub\nYou might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. “Markdown” is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point! To learn more about using GitHub’s flavor of markdown, read “Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax”.\n\n\nEngaging with the GitHub community\nThe GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day—students like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start.\n\nStarring repositories\nIf you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it’s also used as a signal to surface better recommendations on github.com/explore. If you’d like to get back to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. To learn more about starring repositories, read “Saving Repositories with Stars”.\n\n\nFollowing users\nYou can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their public GitHub activity will show up on your dashboard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. To learn more about following users, read “Following People”.\n\n\nBrowsing GitHub Explore\nGitHub Explore is a great place to do just that … explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.\nYou can check out the GitHub Explore website at github.com/explore. The more you intereact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be."

    "text": "Git and GitHub\nGit is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!\nGitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.\nGitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you’re visualizing data or building a new game, there’s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we’ll dig into the rest later."

    "section": "Understanding the GitHub flow",
    "text": "Understanding the GitHub flow\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.\n\nRepositories\nA repository is where your project work happens–think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.\n\n\nCloning\nWhen a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read “Cloning a Repository”.\n\n\nCommitting and pushing\nCommitting and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.” You can also add a helpful commit message to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. “Added a README with information about our project”).\nOnce you have a commit or multiple commits that you’re ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you’ll get used to it 🙂"

    "section": "💻 GitHub terms to know",
    "text": "💻 GitHub terms to know\n\nRepositories\nWe mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let’s talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your “GitHub dashboard” helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you’re logged in to see it!\nRepositories also contain READMEs. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. 😄 To learn more about repositories read “Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories and “About README’s”.\n\n\nBranches\nYou can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository—main. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository. To learn more about branching, read “About Branches”.\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use branches.\n\n\nForks\nA fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else’s project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects! To learn more about forking, read “Fork a repo”\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use forks.\n\n\nPull requests\nWhen working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch. To learn more about pull requests, read “About Pull Requests”.\nNote: In this course, you will not be required to use pull requests.\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!\nFor larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them in this “About Project boards document. You likely won’t need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they’re a great way to organize your team’s work! You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read “About Issues”.\n\n\nYour user profile\nYour profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you’re interested in, the contributions you’ve made, and the conversations you’ve had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read “Managing Your Profile README”.\n\n\nUsing markdown on GitHub\nYou might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. “Markdown” is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point! To learn more about using GitHub’s flavor of markdown, read “Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax”.\n\n\nEngaging with the GitHub community\nThe GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day—students like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start.\n\nStarring repositories\nIf you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it’s also used as a signal to surface better recommendations on github.com/explore. If you’d like to get back to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. To learn more about starring repositories, read “Saving Repositories with Stars”.\n\n\nFollowing users\nYou can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their public GitHub activity will show up on your dashboard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. To learn more about following users, read “Following People”.\n\n\nBrowsing GitHub Explore\nGitHub Explore is a great place to do just that … explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.\nYou can check out the GitHub Explore website at github.com/explore. The more you intereact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be."

I will give you 50% extra credit if you provide answers in both languages.

But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”\n\nStart by filling in the following table for the numbers 1:30 manually, to get a feel for the task.\n\nFizzbuzz for 1:30\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nOn paper or using a tool such as excalidraw.com, create a program flow map for the sequence of if-statements you need to evaluate for fizzbuzz. Add the picture to the folder containing this file, and name the picture flowchart.png. Add the picture to Git and commit/push your changes.\n\n\n\nProgram Flow map for FizzBuzz\n\n\nIn the chunk below, write code which will solve this problem for a single value x.

Can you generalize this, writing a function fizzbuzz that takes a variable x and returns a corresponding fizzbuzzified variable? Your function should be able to handle x that is a vector or a scalar value, and should store your solution in yy.\n\nxx &lt;- sample(1:100, 10) # get a random xx\nyy &lt;- rep(NA, 10)\n\nfizzbuzz &lt;- function(x) {\n  # Your code goes here\n}\n\nyy &lt;- fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres &lt;- cbind(x = xx, result = yy)\nres\n\n       x\n [1,] 46\n [2,] 21\n [3,] 90\n [4,] 85\n [5,] 70\n [6,] 23\n [7,] 83\n [8,] 26\n [9,]  7\n[10,] 60\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom random import choices\nxx = np.array(choices(range(100), k = 10)) + 1\n\n\ndef fizzbuzz(x):\n  y = [np.nan]*len(x) # this just defines something to return\n  # Your code goes here\n  return y\n\nyy = fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": xx, \"result\": yy})\nres\n\n    x  result\n0  69     NaN\n1  73     NaN\n2  78     NaN\n3  26     NaN\n4  49     NaN\n5  26     NaN\n6  48     NaN\n7  70     NaN\n8  69     NaN\n9  36     NaN\n\n\n\n\nDefensive Programming\nYou cannot always assume that the person using your functions knows what they’re doing. Add a check to the function you wrote in the last question so that it will handle non-numeric input by issuing an error message.\nIn R, you can use the function stopifnot() to halt function execution if there is an error; this will give you a basic error message.\n\nstopifnot(2 &gt; 3)\n\nError: 2 &gt; 3 is not TRUE\n\n\nIn Python, you can use a try: statement with a except: clause. This functions like an if-else statement, where if no error occurs, the except statement is never executed.\n\ntry: \n  int(\"hello\")\nexcept ValueError: \n  print(\"Error: could not turn value into an integer\")\n\nError: could not turn value into an integer\n\n\nSee more examples of this in the Input Validation section of the textbook.\n\nxx &lt;- sample(1:100, 10) # get a random xx\nyy &lt;- rep(NA, 10)\n\nfizzbuzz &lt;- function(x) {\n  # Your code goes here\n}\n\nyy &lt;- fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres &lt;- cbind(x = xx, result = yy)\nres\n\n       x\n [1,] 51\n [2,]  8\n [3,] 20\n [4,] 28\n [5,] 25\n [6,] 60\n [7,] 42\n [8,] 57\n [9,] 78\n[10,] 30\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom random import choices\nxx = np.array(choices(range(100), k = 10)) + 1\n\n\ndef fizzbuzz(x):\n  y = [np.nan]*len(x) # this just defines something to return\n  # Your code goes here\n  return y\n\nyy = fizzbuzz(x = xx)\n\n# Printing the results in a data frame\nres = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": xx, \"result\": yy})\nres\n\n    x  result\n0  45     NaN\n1  52     NaN\n2  19     NaN\n3   4     NaN\n4  78     NaN\n5  31     NaN\n6  24     NaN\n7   6     NaN\n8   3     NaN\n9  46     NaN"

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nExploratory data analysis is the process of getting familiar with your dataset. To get started, this blog post provides a nice checklist to get you thinking:\n\n\nWhat question(s) are you trying to solve (or prove wrong)?\nWhat kind of data do you have and how do you treat different types?\nWhat’s missing from the data and how do you deal with it?\nWhere are the outliers and why should you care about them?\nHow can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?\n\n\n\nGenerating Questions\nGenerate at least 5 questions you might explore using this database of cookie ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkimming the Data\nOne thing we often want to do during EDA is to examine the quality of the data - are there missing values? What quirks might exist in the dataset?\nThe skimr package in R, and the similar skimpy package in python (which has a much better name, in my opinion), can help provide visual summaries of the data.\nInstall both packages, and read the package documentation (R, Python).\n[Part 1] Use each package and generate summaries of your data that require the use of at least some non-default options in each package’s skim function.\n[Part 2] Write 1-2 sentences about what you can tell from each summary display you generate. Did you discover anything new about the data?\n\n\nGenerating Tables\nAnother useful technique for exploratory data analysis is to generate summary tables. You may want to use the dplyr package in R (group_by or count functions), as well as the groupby and count methods in Pandas. Python example, R example\n[Part 1] Using R and Python, generate a table that shows what proportion of recipes contain each type of ingredient, for the most common 20 ingredients.\n[Part 2] Print out a character string that lists all of the ingredients that do not appear in at least 20 recipes.\n(Delete this note, but you can include data values inline in markdown text by using backticks, at least in R. For instance, here is R’s built in value for pi: 3.1415927. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work in python using the knitr markdown engine, but you can print the list out in python anyways using a code chunk.)\n\n\nVisualization\nUsing whatever plotting system you are comfortable with in R or python, see if you can create a couple of useful exploratory data visualizations which address one of the questions you wrote above - or another question which you’ve come up with as you’ve worked on this assignment.\n[Part 1] Create at least one plot (it doesn’t have to be pretty) that showcases an interesting facet of the data.\n[Part 2] Write 2-3 sentences about what you can learn from that plot and what directions you might want to investigate from here."

There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more.\nPick R or Python, and solve the murder mystery, showing all of your work in this document.\nYour solution must be reproducible – that is, you should use dplyr verbs, table joins, etc. to solve the mystery, rather than just looking through the tables yourselves.\nYou may work in groups of 2-4 people on this assignment. Each person should turn in their own assignment, but should list their group members as authors.\nMake sure you do your due diligence! You should double check your answer and print out the guilty party’s interview from the database.\nWhen you are finished with the assignment:\n\nOnce you have finished this assignment, render the document (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-K or the Render button).\nCommit the qmd file and any other files you have changed to the repository and push your changes.\nIn Canvas, submit a link to your github repository containing the updated files.\nProvide the name of the guilty party in the text input field on Canvas, and make sure all of your work is on GitHub to receive full credit.\n\nThe chunks below use the code to read in each of the 8 tables of data for this assignment.\nHints:\n\nYou can use a lot of filter statements, but it will in many cases be easier to use joins.\nSee if you can write code that doesn’t require you to type out knowledge gained from a previous clue (e.g. pipe your results from one query into the next)\n\n\nA crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on January 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use R and SAS to navigate through this network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.\nThis database schema may help you figure out how to navigate the database:\n\n\n\nsql-murder-mystery database schema diagram"

Your function should have required parameter \\(x\\) and optional parameters \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) representing the true values. The function should return a list of \\(\\hat\\alpha, \\hat\\beta\\) and, if \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) are provided, it should also return \\(\\alpha_{err} = \\alpha-\\hat\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta_{err} = \\beta-\\hat\\beta\\).\nFor a grid of \\(\\alpha \\times \\beta=\\{0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00\\}\\times\\{0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00\\}\\), sample 100 values from the \\(\\text{gamma}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) distribution. Provide the true parameter values and plot your error values in an appropriate plot. Take care to choose your plot mappings to support your discussion of the following: What trends (if any) do you notice in the estimation error?\nNow, let’s vary the sample size. For \\(n=\\{20, 30, 50, 100\\}\\), use your function to evaluate the error for \\(\\alpha=1, \\beta=2\\). How does the error change as \\(n\\) increases?

    "text": "Monte Carlo Integration\nLet’s think a bit about what we did last time. We created rectangles, broke our function down into pieces, and evaluated the area of each piece. But in each loop iteration we throw away all of our previous work, which isn’t really that efficient.\nWhat if instead we sample points \\(x\\) randomly from \\([-2, 2]\\), evaluate each point at \\(f(x)\\), and take the average value? Then we can keep adding points as necessary until we reach the desired accuracy.\nTo make this point, I’m going to do something slightly less efficient: generate a bunch of data and let you see how the result changes as more data is added to the stack.\n\nmc_data &lt;- tibble(x = runif(10000000, -2, 2), y = f(x)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Number of data values\n    n = row_number(),\n    # Sum of all data values up to that point\n    ysum = cumsum(y),\n    # Cumulative mean\n    yavg = ysum/n,\n    # Multiply by x range to get estimate\n    est = (2 - (-2)) * yavg,\n    err = pi - est\n  )\n\n# Ggplot isn't gonna like having 100 million points, so let's focus on the gist of this...\nplot_data &lt;- mc_data[c(1:1000, \n                       (101:999)*10, \n                       round(seq(10000, nrow(mc_data), length.out = 50000))),]\nggplot(plot_data,\n       aes(x = n, y = est)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = pi), color = \"red\") +\n  scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Get differences between successive iterations\ndiffs &lt;- diff(mc_data$est)\n\n# How many data points until we could stop?\n# Get all iterations within tol of the answer from the next iteration\nall_close_iterations &lt;- which(abs(diffs) &lt; tol)\n\n# If we stop at the first time that 2 successive observations are within tol,\n# we will stop too early\n(npts &lt;- min(all_close_iterations))\n\n[1] 215003\n\nsprintf(\"%0.09f\", mc_data$est[npts + 1])\n\n[1] \"3.134228238\"\n\n# Safer - stop when you've got multiple times where you've hit the tolerance \n# threshold\nsprintf(\"%0.09f\", mc_data$est[all_close_iterations[1000]])\n\n[1] \"3.135998537\"\n\n\nIn the end, MC integration doesn’t have quite the level of precision of other ways to computationally solve the problem, but it also comes without restrictions on things like continuity conditions.\nIt’s worth noting that the MC method I used here is 1) extremely simple, and 2) different than that used in the blog post.\nMC integration is usually used for higher-dimensional integrals, so there are lots of strategies to make that more efficient. I’ve gone for a slightly more efficient method than was used in the blog post but my approach is also probably more fragile (and doesn’t really rely on randomness - it’s the same basic approach I took in the previous section)."
