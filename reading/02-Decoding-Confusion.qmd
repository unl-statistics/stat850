This week's reading assignment is from The Programmer's Brain: What Every Programmer Needs to Know About Cognition by Felienne Hermans.

Remember to use hypothes.is for annotation and to make sure you're posting your annotations in the course group!

Note that the examples in this book are given in unfamiliar programming languages. That's ok - read the code as best as you can, but part of the content of this chapter is that reading code can be hard!
