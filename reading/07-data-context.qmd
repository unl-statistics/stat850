Annotate with hypothes.is

Note: I assign chapters from Data Feminism because the authors made me think differently about data. I don't necessarily agree with everything they say, and I certainly don't expect you to agree with them either - I want you to stretch your brains and consider things from a different perspective. 

Think about/comment on: 

- Do you agree/disagree with the assertion that the context of the data matters?
- How does maintaining good data documentation contribute to data context? What problems does it not solve?
- Do you prefer working with raw data? cooked data? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
