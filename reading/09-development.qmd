Read: 

- [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210v1/) (Annotate the embedded PDF. I know, this is less than ideal.)

- [Common errors in R: An Empirical Investigation](https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems/blob/master/misc/stack-overflow-common-r-errors.md)

Annotate with hypothes.is

Think about/comment on: 

- What good practices do the authors recommend?

- What do you agree/disagree with?

- What suggestions seem strange/impractical?
