These are copied directly from the textbook chapters we have covered. 
Anything that you have to do that doesn't fall under one of these objectives (e.g. plotting) will have sample code provided that will be relatively simple to change to get to the required objective. 

## Computer Basics


- Know the meaning of computer hardware and operating system terms such as hard drive, memory, CPU, OS/operating system, file system, directory, and system paths

- Understand the basics of how the above concepts relate to each other and contribute to how a computer works

- Understand the file system mental model for computers enough to identify where your files are stored

- Locate and follow directions for software installation based on your computer’s hardware and operating system.

## Setting Up Your Computer

- Set up RStudio, R, Quarto, and python

## Scripts and Notebooks and Terminals


- Understand the different ways you can interact with a programming language
- Identify which interface (terminal, interactive, script, notebook) and language are being used based on the appearance of the interface
- Select the appropriate way of interacting with a computer for a given task given considerations such as target audience, human intervention, and need to repeat the analysis.
