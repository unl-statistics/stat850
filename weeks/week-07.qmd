# Week 7: Data Joins &Transformations

## 📖 Reading

For Class:

- [ ] [Reshaping Data](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/05-data-reshape.html)
- [ ] [Joining Data](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/06-data-join.html)
- [ ] [Normal Forms of Data](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/05b-normal-forms.html) (optional, but useful)

Context:

- [ ] [Chapter 6: “The Numbers Don’t Speak For Themselves” of Data Feminism by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973143050006387?auth=SAML)

Note: I assign one or two chapters from Data Feminism in Stat 850 because the authors made me think differently about data. I don't necessarily agree with everything they say, and I certainly don't expect you to agree with them either - I want you to stretch your brains and consider things from a different perspective.  

Think about:  

- Do you agree/disagree with the assertion that the context of the data matters? 
- How does maintaining good data documentation contribute to data context? What problems does it not solve? 
- Do you prefer working with raw data? cooked data? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
