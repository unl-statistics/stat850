# Week 1: Exploring the Toolbox

## 📖 Reading

For Class: 

- [ ] Read the [syllabus](../syllabus.qmd)
- [ ] Read [Computer Basics](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/01-computer-basics.html)
- [ ] Read [Setting up your Computer](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/02-setting-up-computer.html)
- [ ] Read [Rstudio’s Interface](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/03-Rstudio-interface.html)
- [ ] Read [Scripts and Notebooks](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/04-scripts-notebooks.html)
- [ ] Read [Version Control with Git](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/05-git-and-github.html)

Hopefully, Computer Basics will be familiar to you, and the remaining information will just serve to orient you to the tools we’ll be using this semester. Focus on the last two chapters – Scripts and Notebooks, and Version control with Git – as those sections tend to be more tricky.

Context: 

- [ ] [R4DS Introduction](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro.html)
- [ ] [Oh Shit, Git!: Recipes for Getting Out of a Git Mess, by Julia Evans](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16972919150006387?auth=SAML) (optional, but useful, and in comic form)
