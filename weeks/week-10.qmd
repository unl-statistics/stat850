# Week 10: Reproducibility, Reproducible Examples, and Advanced Quarto

## üìñ Reading

For Class:

- [ ] [Debugging and Reproducible Examples](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/06-debugging.html)
- [ ] [Reproducibility and Professional Communication](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/06-documents.html)

Context: 

- [ ] [Common errors in R: An Empirical Investigation](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973345280006387?auth=SAML)
- [ ] [Framed! Reproducing and Revisiting 150-year-old Charts](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973346280006387?auth=SAML)
- [ ] [A Study in Reproducibility: The Congruent Matching Cells Algorithm and cmcR package](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973346790006387?auth=SAML)  (Optional)
- [ ] [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973344600006387?auth=SAML) (Recommended)
- How important is long-term reproducibility?  
- How do the two articles differ with respect to types of reproducibility?   
- What attempts at reproducibility worked and didn't work in each article?  
- What important factors must exist for reproducibility?  

Other Resources (not required):  

- You can see all of the pages of the Statistical Atlases at the Library of Congress (and even download extremely high resolution scans, if you want to):
     - [9th census (1870)](https://www.loc.gov/item/05019329/)
     - [10th census (1880)](https://www.loc.gov/item/a40001834/)
     - [11th census (1890)](https://www.loc.gov/item/07019233)
     - [Census page with links to other censuses](https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/geography/statistical_atlases.html) 
- the 1900,1910, and 1920 census atlases are not nearly as impressive.
    - A Modern [Census Atlas](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2007/dec/censr-29.html) produced in 2007 attempted to reclaim this graphical history.
