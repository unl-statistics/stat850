Think about: 

- What do you think about Tukey's approach to exploratory data analysis? 
- What new ways to use Stem and Leaf plots did you see? 
- How has the use of computers made EDA easier? Harder? 
- How does EDA change when it’s easy to make new plots? Is that change good, bad, mixed, or neutral?
