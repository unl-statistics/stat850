Think about: 

- What basic computing skills were you taught? Which ones were you not taught? 
- Which workflows do you think will be useful to you? Which ones do you plan to ignore for now? Why? 
- If you are planning to ignore one or more workflows, when (if ever) do you think you will want or need to learn them?
