# Week 4: Data Programming

## 📖 Reading

For Class: 

 - [ ] [Programming with Data](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/07-prog-data.html)

Context:

- [ ] [Chapter 2: “A Pragmatic Approach” of The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery, by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973139740006387?auth=SAML). As you read this chapter, make a checklist of good code practices that you can use before submitting your homework.  Make a note of principles you don’t understand yet (that’s ok!) that you can come back to at the end of the semester. 
- [ ] [Tidy Tuesday Screencast: Doctor Who, by David Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/live/89l_3Y53qMM?feature=shared).    
- [ ] [How does Software Development Compare with Statistical Programming/Analysis](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973101700006387?auth=SAML) - a StackOverflow discussion of differences between software development and statistical programming. Not an exhaustive set of viewpoints, but a useful discussion to read. 

Think about: 

- What did you learn from watching someone else do data analysis in realtime? 
- In your opinion, does programming with data differ from software development? How, and in what ways? 
- What skills are shared between software dev and statistical programming, and what skills are specific to each?
