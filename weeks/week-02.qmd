# Week 2: Introduction to Programming and Variable Types

## 📖 Reading

For Class:

- [ ] [Introduction to Programming](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/00-intro.html)
- [ ] [Variables and Basic Data Types](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/01-basic-var-types.html)
- [ ] [Getting Started with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)

Context:

- [ ] [Chapter 2 of The Programmer’s Brain: What Every Programmer Needs to Know About Cognition by Felienne Hermans](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/12345046000006387?auth=SAML)
   Note that the examples in this book are given in unfamiliar programming languages. That's ok -  read the code as best as you can, but part of the point of this chapter is that reading code can be hard, and it’s useful to see how the programming language affects that perception. 
- [ ] [How Integers and Floats Work, by Julia Evans](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16972919280006387?auth=SAML) (optional)
