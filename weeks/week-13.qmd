# Week 13: Simulation

## üìñ Reading

For Class:  

- [ ] [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/17174409750006387?auth=SAML) 
- [ ] [Probability Theory Shown by Simulation](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/17174410770006387?auth=SAML) (Optional) 
- [ ] [Resampling Methods](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/17174411360006387?auth=SAML) (Optional)  

Historically, students have a very hard time with the simulation question on the statistics qualifier. I‚Äôm experimenting this year with some ways to reinforce this material, despite the fact that you‚Äôll be asked to apply simulation to models and use cases you may not have learned yet, since Stat 850 is taken during your first semester. [This book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/simulation-for-data/9781785881169/?sso_link=yes&sso_link_from=unl-edu) is a good resource for you to keep in mind when studying for the qualifying exam and is available online for free through the library.   

Other Resources:  

- [ ] [Statistical Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= sTXVNbe8fto) - ~1h long lecture on statistical model simulation 
- [ ] [The Strange Math That Predicts Almost Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZeIEiBrT_w) - ~30 minutes, Importance of Monte Carlo Simulation
