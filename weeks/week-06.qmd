Context: 

- [ ] [Chapter 5: “Designing and Structuring Data Pipelines” from The Pragmatic Programmer for Machine Learning by Marco Scutari and Mauro Malvestio](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973142100006387?auth=SAML)

- [ ] [Pandas vs. dplyr Reddit discussion](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973146240006387?auth=SAML) (optional, but useful to understand why pandas is different than dplyr)
- [ ] [Method chaining in Pandas](https://unl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01UON_LINC/citation/16973147040006387?auth=SAML) (optional but useful)

Think about:

- What do you think the strengths and weaknesses are of the `dplyr` approach to tidy code compared to `pandas`? 
- What do you need to focus on when writing code if you want to make your code tidy? 
- Which approach to data manipulation do you prefer? Why? Is there a case where you would prefer the other program?
