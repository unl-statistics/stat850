## Exams

- Midterm and Final

- In class component + take-home component

- Final take-home component will happen during "dead week"

- Exams will include at least one response question from the contextual readings


## AI Use Policy

- Using AI to write code (Don't!)

- Using AI to explain an error (Ok)

- Using AI to write explanations (Don't)

- If you use AI
  - Document the use, version, input, and output
  - Provide a diff of your submission vs. the AI output

## Oral Exams

- I reserve the right to replace any grade with an oral exam on your submission

- Allows me to clarify how much you understand when that isn't clear

- Helps when I write an ambiguous question or you miss a key part of a question

- If you can't explain your code/answer you don't get any credit
