## Today's Goals:

- Work on deliverable number 3 for homework 11: simulate!


- Three deliverables in total: `pseudocode.qmd`, `craps-code.qmd`, and `simulation.qmd` (this week)

----

## `Simulate.qmd`

- In your repo, create a file with that name.

- You need to answer the following three questions:
  
  1. Which probability do you want to estimate?
  2. What is the simulation result (in numbers and visuals)?
  3. What is the simulation variability?

Make sure to set a seed to make your analysis reproducible.
