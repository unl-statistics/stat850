# LaTeX

## LaTeX is a document preparation system 

::: columns
::: column-left

Think of it as the digital version of a printing press.

You will use **tags** to control the formatting of your document, and then compile it to PDF. 
- `\emph{}` for *italic* text
- `\textbf{}` for **bold** text
- `{\HUGE }`, `{\footnotesize }`


The LaTeX system lays out your document according to a set of rules for spacing, margins, figure captions, cross-references, ...

> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do.

> â€” Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984

## LaTeX Editors

While a .tex file is just a text file, it can help to use a dedicated editor that will compile your document for you.

Some options:

- Overleaf.com (real-time compilation, collaboration)
- TeXWorks
- LyX - What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) LaTeX editor
- RStudio

Of these, Lyx and Rstudio support integrating your code with your document using knitr/Sweave.

## BibTeX

One of the most wonderful parts of LaTeX is BibTeX, which handles your citations for you.

- You type your references in only once (in a markup style called bibtex)
- Citations in your paper are \citet{key} or \citep{key} or \cite{key}
- You set the reference type at the top of the document (numeric, alphabetical, etc.)
- At the end of the document you add a command for where the bibliography goes

Bibtex does all of the hard work of cross-linking your references with the bibliography, formatting the bibliography correctly, etc.

Zotero, Mendeley, etc. have BibTeX export functions so you can still use a reference manager.

## Typesetting math

Math mode:
`$x + 2$` for inline math: $x + 2$

`$$` `x+2` `$$`  for centered paragraph math 
$$x + 2$$

`\begin` `{align} x &= a + b\\ y &= c + d` `\end{align}`    
for systems of equations

$\begin{align} x &= a + b\\ y &= c + d\end{align}$

`\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \infty, \rightarrow, \int,\frac{a}{b}` 
$$\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\infty,\rightarrow,\int,\frac{a}{b}$$

1. [Add an image](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images)

2. Add the [quadratic formula and the PDF of a normal distribution to the document](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)

3. In extremely [large](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Font_sizes,_families,_and_styles) text, print LaTeX using the `\LaTeX` command

# But I don't want a PDF

## Pandoc

LaTeX only creates PDF files (and PostScript files, but nevermind those). 

Enter **pandoc**, which was supposed to be a "universal translator" of markup formats.

Markdown document -> 

- html
- epub
- docx
- LaTeX
- other markdown flavors
- ...

With pandoc, the goal is to transfer the content; the exact formatting is less of a priority. Thus, only a small set of formatting options are supported.


You can use the same BibTeX files in markdown with Pandoc!

# Adding in R

---
name: knitr
## LaTeX + R?

`Sweave` was the original document compilation system for combining `LaTeX` and `R` (created circa 2002)

- Basic structure was great
- Caching was terrible (so all code re-ran each time you changed formatting a bit)

`knitr`: created in 2012 by Yihui Xie to be a better version of `Sweave`

- Same basic syntax
- better caching & dependency management
- All `Sweave` features + some
- Support for Python, Perl, C++, shell scripts

## LaTeX + R?

[knitr reference manual](https://yihui.org/knitr/)


To add R code to your .tex file, 

1. Change the file extension from `.tex` to `.Rnw` (Rnw = R no weave, a holdover from `Sweave`)

2. Add R code chunks 

3. Compile your document


```
<<chunk-name, chunk-options>>=

R code here

@
```

---
name: rmarkdown
## Markdown + R?

You've been using Rmarkdown for the entire semester, but it works essentially the same way as adding R to LaTeX:

![Rmarkdown Workflow](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/images/workflow.png)



.center[The [newest release of RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) has WYSIWYG support for RMarkdown (but not yet for LaTeX).]

---

## Code Chunk Options

[Common chunk options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/):

- `eval = (T/F)`: whether the code is evaluated by R

- `include = (T/F)`: should code or output from the code be included in the document?

- `echo = (T/F)`: should code be printed in the document, or just the output?

- `fig.width, fig.height = `: size of the saved image, in inches 

- `out.width = `: width of the output image IN THE DOCUMENT

- `fig.cap = `: Set a figure caption

- `cache = (T/F)`: Cache the chunk, so that it is only re-run if it changes?

*All of these chunk options also work in rmarkdown*

## Try it out!

Turn your .tex file into an .Rnw file and add some more stuff!

1. Add a histogram of 100 draws from a normal distribution
```{r, eval = F}
hist(rnorm(100))
```

2. Compute the mean of 15 draws from a binomial(10, .5) distribution and print it inline using `\Sexpr{}`
```{r, eval = F}
mean(rbinom(15, 10, .5))
```

3. Use `knitr::kable()` to print out the first 6 rows of the cars dataframe. 
```{r, eval = F}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```

## Table Upgrades

Table Packages

- kableExtra
- [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/)
- [huxtable](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/)

---
## Special Document Types

Both LaTeX and Rmarkdown make use of other libraries to expand the types of documents available. 


Document Type | Library | Compiler | End Result
----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Slides | Beamer | LaTeX or Markdown + LaTeX | PDF
| IOSlides | Markdown | HTML
| Slidy | Markdown | HTML
| PowerPoint | Markdown | PowerPoint
| Xaringan | Markdown + JS | HTML/markdown hybrid 
Poster | Beamer | LaTeX | PDF
| Posterdown | Markdown | HTML
| Pagedown | Markdown | HTML

.center[These documents use the same basic markdown or LaTeX syntax, but render differently.]
