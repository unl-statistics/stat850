## This week's big picture goal:

Working with text and practicing exploration skills

---

## Organization

- code for homework submissions: 
  
  - always make sure that the `index.qmd` file renders for you (that's where your answers are *supposed* to be)

  - comment out any and all calls that produce: 
    
      - excessive output: `ls()`, `dir()`, `print()`
  
      - additional windows: `View()`, `?` (or `??`, `help`), 
      
      - install software: `install.packages()`,  
  
  - references to files outside of your repository

## Today's Goals:


- Exploration!


Ideally you have passed checkpoint 2 for both R and python. If not, finish up checkpoint 2 for one language and proceed with that.
